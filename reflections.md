<div class="home" id="project">
	<h1 class="pageTitle">Reflection Questions</h1>
	<p>When preparing to present papers for the class, consider the following questions:
		<ul>
			<li>What problem in healthcare is this paper addressing?</li>
			<li>What is the corresponding category of problem in ML that we can map this problem onto?</li>
			<li>What machine learning approaches are the authors proposing/using?</li>
			<li>Do standard ML methods do the trick?</li>
			<li>What is special about the HC problem that the methods need to adapt to?</li>
			<li>Were appropriate checks in place for model testing or avoiding model misspecification?</li>
			<li>What type of confounders are present in the health care data? how does the model address those confounders?</li>
			<li>How does the approach quantify uncertainty? Is uncertainty important here?</li>
			<li>Are there limited numbers of samples? how are those addressed?</li>
			<li>How can I determine whether a specific patient's sample is similar to others, or unique? (the n of 1 problem)</li>
			<li>How is patient/patient group heterogeneity addressed?</li>
			<li>How can you quantify the most important features of the data? Are the methods interpretable?</li>
			<li>How are doctor/caregiver mistakes accounted for?</li>
			<li>Are there possible biases introduced by the data or the ML method?</li>
			<li>What are ways to combat those biases?</li>
			<li>How would you explain to a doctor how the method worked, or why it arrived at a class label/decision?</li>
			<li>what is the distance that needs to be covered before this method is deployed in a healthcare setting?</li>
		</ul>
